Momoh (M’76-SM’89) received the B.S.E.E. degree from Howard University in 1975, the M.S.E.E. degree from Carnegie Mellon University in 1976, the M.S. in systems engineering from the University of Pennsylvania in 1980 and the Ph.D in Electrical Engineering from Howard University in 1983. Dr. Momoh is chairman of the Electrical Engineering department at Howard University and also the director of the Center for Energy Systems and Controls. His current research activities are concentrated in stability analysis, system security and expert systems design for utility firms and government agencies. In 1987, he received a National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award. He is the author of over hundred research publications. Mohamed E. El-Hawary (S’ 68, M’72, SM’ 76, F 90), was born in Egypt. He received a Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical Engineering from the University of Alexandria, Egypt, and a Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. He has held academic and research appointments at the University of Alexandria, the University of Alberta, the Graduate School of Engineering at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (COPPE), Memorial University of Newfoundland, and the Technical University of Nova Scotia where he is presently a Professor of Electrical Engineering. Dr. El-Hawary’s research interests are in power system economics and computational methods in power systems engineering. He has authored or coauthored over 80 research publications and is author of a number of books including Optimal Economic Operation of Electric Power Systems, with G.S. Christensen, Academic Press, Electric Power System Design and Analvsis, Principles of Electric Machines with Power Electronic Applications, Control Svstem Engineering, all with Prentice-Hall. He has served IEEE in many capacities both at the Section, Canadian Region, and Technical Society levels. He is a Fellow both of IEEE and the Engineering Institute of Canada and is a Past President of the Canadian Society for Electrical Engineering.","Carpentier, J., ""Contribution A.
