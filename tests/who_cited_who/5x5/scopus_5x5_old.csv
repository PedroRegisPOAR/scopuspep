0,Energy,"This paper presents an efficient and reliable evolutionary-based approach to solve the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem by considering the emission issue. The OPF problem has been widely used in power system operation and planning for determining electricity prices. Therefore, the conventional optimal power flow cannot meet the environmental protection requirements, because it only considers generation cost minimization. The multi-objective optimal power flow considers economical and emission issues. By adding the emission objective in the optimal power flow problem, this problem become more complicated than before and it needs to be solved with an accurate algorithm. This paper proposes an algorithm based on the Shuffle Frog Leaping Algorithm (SLFA) to solve the multi-objective OPF problem. Furthermore, this paper presents a modified SLFA called MSLFA algorithm which profits from a mutation in order to reduce the processing time and improve the quality of solutions, particularly to avoid being trapped in local optima. The IEEE 30-bus test system is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed problem. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Shiraz University of Technology, Shiraz, Iran; Department of Electrical Engineering, Marvdasht Branch, Islamic Azad University, Marvdasht, Iran; Young Researchers Club, Zarghan Branch, Islamic Azad University, Zarghan, Iran",,9742806100;56565093400;56957945900;57196930231;,Emission; Generation cost; Optimal power flow; Shuffle frog leaping algorithm,"Niknam T., Narimani M.R., Jabbari M., Malekpour A.R.","Niknam, T., Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Shiraz University of Technology, Shiraz, Iran; Narimani, M.R., Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Shiraz University of Technology, Shiraz, Iran; Jabbari, M., Department of Electrical Engineering, Marvdasht Branch, Islamic Azad University, Marvdasht, Iran; Malekpour, A.R., Young Researchers Club, Zarghan Branch, Islamic Azad University, Zarghan, Iran",ENEYD,,130,,,,,"Jabbari, M.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Marvdasht Branch, Islamic Azad University, Marvdasht, Iran; email: tatnma2002@yahoo.com",10.1016/j.energy.2011.09.027,Article,2-s2.0-80655124471,,,,,,3605442,Acoustic generators; Electric load flow; Multiobjective optimization; Profitability; Electricity prices; Generation cost; Local optima; Multi objective; Multi-objective optimal power flow; Optimal power flow; Optimal power flow problem; Optimal power flows; Power system operations; Processing Time; Quality of solution; Shuffle frog leaping algorithm; Test systems; Evolutionary algorithms; algorithm; cost-benefit analysis; electricity; emission; environmental protection; power; Anura,11,English,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80655124471&doi=10.1016%2fj.energy.2011.09.027&partnerID=40&md5=83080848970e74050b31d5fa9d3973b9,,,,6432,6420,,Elsevier Ltd,"Al-Muhawesh, T., Qamber, I.S., The established mega watt linear programming-based optimal power flow model applied to the real power 56-bus system in eastern province of Saudi Arabia (2008) Energy, 33 (1), pp. 12-21; Vaisakh, K., Srinivas, L.R., A genetic evolving ant direction DE for OPF with non-smooth cost functions and statistical analysis (2010) Energy, 35 (8), pp. 3155-3171; Momoh, J.A., El-Hawary, M.E., Adapa, R., A review of selected optimal power literature to 1993.

0,Energy,"A current trend in electric power industries is the deregulation around the world. One of the questions arise during any deregulation process is: where will be the future generation expansion? In the present paper, the study is concentrated on the wheeling computational method as a part of mega watt (MW) linear programming-based optimal power flow (LP-based OPF) method. To observe the effects of power wheeling on the power system operations, the paper uses linear interactive & discrete optimizer (LINDO) optimizer software as a powerful tool for solving linear programming problems to evaluate the influence of the power wheeling. As well, the paper uses the optimization tool to solve the economic generation dispatch and transmission management problems. The transmission line flow was taken in consideration with some constraints discussed in this paper. The complete linear model of the MW LP-based OPF, which is used to know the future generation potential areas in any utility is proposed. The paper also explains the available economic load dispatch (ELD) as the basic optimization tool to dispatch the power system. It can be concluded in the present study that accuracy is expensive in terms of money and time and in the competitive market enough accuracy is needed without paying much. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

0,Energy,"Electricity demand forecasting plays an important role in electricity systems expansion planning. In this paper, we present a trigonometric grey prediction approach by combining the traditional grey model GM(1,1) with the trigonometric residual modification technique for forecasting electricity demand. Our approach helps to improve the forecasting accuracy of the GM(1,1) and allows a reasonable grey prediction interval to be obtained. Two case studies using the data of China are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
