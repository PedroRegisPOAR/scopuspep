The OPF problem has been widely used in power system operation and planning for determining electricity prices. Therefore, the conventional optimal power flow cannot meet the environmental protection requirements, because it only considers generation cost minimization. The multi-objective optimal power flow considers economical and emission issues. By adding the emission objective in the optimal power flow problem, this problem become more complicated than before and it needs to be solved with an accurate algorithm. This paper proposes an algorithm based on the Shuffle Frog Leaping Algorithm (SLFA) to solve the multi-objective OPF problem. Furthermore, this paper presents a modified SLFA called MSLFA algorithm which profits from a mutation in order to reduce the processing time and improve the quality of solutions, particularly to avoid being trapped in local optima. The IEEE 30-bus test system is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed problem. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Emission; Generation cost; Optimal power flow; Shuffle frog leaping algorithm","Acoustic generators; Electric load flow; Multiobjective optimization; Profitability; Electricity prices; Generation cost; Local optima; Multi objective; Multi-objective optimal power flow; Optimal power flow; Optimal power flow problem; Optimal power flows; Power system operations; Processing Time; Quality of solution; Shuffle frog leaping algorithm; Test systems; Evolutionary algorithms; algorithm; cost-benefit analysis; electricity; emission; environmental protection; power; Anura",,,,,,"Al-Muhawesh, T., Qamber, I.S., The established mega watt linear programming-based optimal power flow model applied to the real power 56-bus system in eastern province of Saudi Arabia (2008) Energy, 33 (1), pp. 12-21; Vaisakh, K., Srinivas, L.R., A genetic evolving ant direction DE for OPF with non-smooth cost functions and statistical analysis (2010) Energy, 35 (8), pp. 3155-3171; Momoh, J.A., El-Hawary, M.E., Adapa, R., A review of selected optimal power literature to 1993.
