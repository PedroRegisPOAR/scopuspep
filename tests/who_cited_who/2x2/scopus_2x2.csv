Geotech. Test. J.,"Seepage monitoring is an important element in geotechnical engineering. This article proposed a new integrated system for seepage monitoring composed of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing system and a water-heating cycling system. The boiler is used as the heating equipment in the integrated system. The heated water is distributed to each heating pipeline for cyclic heating through the water separator and water collector. The FBG temperature sensors are preburied in the heating pipeline to monitor the water temperature in real time. Recognizing the correlation between the temperature field and the seepage field, we proposed to fit coefficient E,v according to the cooling curve and used it as an index to identify the seepage state. We conducted this numerical simulation to analyze the heat transfer process of the heat source in the porous media. We carried out the calibration experiments of seepage velocity using the FBG-sensing heating system in the porous medium with four different gradations. Our results showed that the temperature gradient decreased over time, indicating that the primary way the heat source was transferred was through the convective heat transfer caused by the seepage. Therefore, the coefficient E,v could be used as the seepage identification index. On the basis of our calibration experiments, we obtained the fitting formulas of E,v and the seepage velocity in four kinds of porous mediums. The formulas can be used for the inversion of seepage velocity. The experimental results proved that E,v was unrelated to the initial cooling temperature. This finding showed that the influence of an uneven temperature distribution along the heating pipeline on monitoring results could be ignored. Â© 2018 ASTM International.

Water Resour. Res.,"Zones of strong groundwater upwelling to streams enhance thermal stability and moderate thermal extremes, which is particularly important to aquatic ecosystems in a warming climate. Passive thermal tracer methods used to quantify vertical upwelling rates rely on downward conduction of surface temperature signals. However, moderate to high groundwater flux rates (&gt;â1.5 m dâ1) restrict downward propagation of diurnal temperature signals, and therefore the applicability of several passive thermal methods. Active streambed heating from within high-resolution fiber-optic temperature sensors (A-HRTS) has the potential to define multidimensional fluid-flux patterns below the extinction depth of surface thermal signals, allowing better quantification and separation of local and regional groundwater discharge. To demonstrate this concept, nine A-HRTS were emplaced vertically into the streambed in a grid with â¼0.40 m lateral spacing at a stream with strong upward vertical flux in Mashpee, Massachusetts, USA. Long-term (8â9 h) heating events were performed to confirm the dominance of vertical flow to the 0.6 m depth, well below the extinction of ambient diurnal signals. To quantify vertical flux, short-term heating events (28 min) were performed at each A-HRTS, and heat-pulse decay over vertical profiles was numerically modeled in radial two dimension (2-D) using SUTRA. Modeled flux values are similar to those obtained with seepage meters, Darcy methods, and analytical modeling of shallow diurnal signals. We also observed repeatable differential heating patterns along the length of vertically oriented sensors that may indicate sediment layering and hyporheic exchange superimposed on regional groundwater discharge.
