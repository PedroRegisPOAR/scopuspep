In this study, rapid time series temperature profiles within open-groundwater wells in fractured rock were measured using fiber optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS). To identify zones of active groundwater flow, two continuous electrical heating cables were installed alongside a FO-DTS cable to heat the column of water within the well and to create a temperature difference between the ambient temperature of the groundwater in the aquifer and that within the well. Additional tests were performed to examine the effects of pumping on hydraulic fracture interconnectivity around the well and to identify zones of increased groundwater flow. High- and low-resolution FO-DTS cable configurations were examined to test the sensitivities of the technique and compared with downhole video footage and geophysical logging to confirm the zones of active groundwater flow. Two examples are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of this new technique for rapid characterization of fracture zones in open boreholes. The combination of the FO-DTS and heating cable has excellent scope as a rapid appraisal tool for borehole construction design and improving hydrogeologic conceptual models. © 2014, National Ground Water Association.",,"Aquifers; Boreholes; Cables; Fracture; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Hydraulic fracturing; Hydrogeology; Temperature; Temperature sensors; Construction design; Distributed temperature sensing; Electrical heating; Geophysical logging; Hydraulic properties; Hydrogeologic conceptual model; Temperature differences; Temperature profiles; Groundwater resources; aquifer; borehole; cable; fiber optics; flow pattern; fracture zone; groundwater flow; heating; hydraulic property; hydrogeology; logging (geophysics); pumping; temperature gradient; temperature profile; time series; videography; water column; water-rock interaction; well; ground water; environmental monitoring; procedures; temperature; water flow; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Temperature; Water Movements",,,,,,"Anderson, M.P., Heat as a ground water tracer (2005) Ground Water, 43 (6), pp. 951-968; Banks, E.W., Simmons, C., Love, A., Cranswick, R., Werner, A., Bestland, E., Wood, M., Wilson, T., Fractured bedrock and saprolite hydrogeologic controls on groundwater/surface-water interaction: A conceptual model (Australia) (2009) Hydrogeology Journal, 17 (8), pp. 1969-1989; Bense, V.F., Person, M.A., Chaudhary, K., You, Y., Cremer, N., Simon, S., Thermal anomalies indicate preferential flow along faults in unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers (2008) Geophysical Research Letters, 35 (24), p.
